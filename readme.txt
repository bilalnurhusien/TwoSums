Description: Implemented a variant of 2-SUM algorithm for sums between 2500 and 4000
using a sorted vector. The task was to compute the number of target values t in the
interval [2500,4000] (inclusive) such that there are distinct numbers x,y in the input
file (HashInt.txt) that satisfy x+y=t. The input file was taken from the Algorithms
and Analysis course taught by Tim Roughgarden on Coursera.

Input file: The input file (HashInt.txt) is in the project directory. Each line of 
the input file contains a positive integer.

Output: The number of target values (t) in the interval [2500,4000] will be displayed
in stdout such that there are distinct numbers x,y in the input file that satisfy x+y=t. 
For the input file, HashInt.txt, the number of target values is 1477.
